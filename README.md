Starting this repository as a way to teach simple, yet detailed aerodynamics programming to new DCS EFM creators. I hope to include the basics of force and moment representation, the basics of blade element theory, and the basics of engine and fuel programming (albeit with simplified DC electric motors and battery as the engine and fuel). The goal of this is to both bring a controllable FPV drone to DCS as well as giving new EFM creators something to turn to to learn the basics of EFM creation and organization. For this purpose, the project may stay as something "non functional" (aka not realistic in proportion/physics, nor necesarilly something to be used by DCS players), but something to use as a learning tool. Doing both, however, is a huge plus. Contribute any way you'd like by submitting issues, pull requests, etc.
